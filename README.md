# Concealment Layers for Online Anonymity and Knowledge (CLOAK)
CLOAK is the first publicly available knowledge base on cybercriminal concealment measures. CLOAK is the result of qualitative scientific research and has been inspired by the famous [MITRE ATT&CKâ„¢](https://attack.mitre.org) framework. CLOAK has been developed by analyzing over 200 Operational Security (OpSec) guides from both the clear- and darkweb. CLOAK's main objective is to contribute to combating cybercrime better and has been made publicly available to allow improvements to be made together with the cybersecurity community. CLOAK's initial version (January 2025) already identified 13 tactics, 109 techniques, 679 sub-techniques, and 586 procedures. Which comes down to a total of 1.459 unique TTP's!
